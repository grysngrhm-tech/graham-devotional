## A New Way to Engage with Scripture

The Bible is the greatest story ever told, yet many of us struggle to engage with it deeply. We read the same passages, but the words can feel distant. The stories blur together. The richness gets lost.

**The Graham Bible exists to change that.**

Each story is presented as a visual devotional—a full-page piece of sacred artwork on one side, and a carefully crafted narrative retelling on the other. This isn't commentary or interpretation. It's the biblical narrative itself, retold with reverence and clarity, preserving the rawness and beauty of Scripture.

The artwork draws from the tradition of classical sacred illustration—the cross-hatching style of Gustave Doré, Albrecht Dürer, and Rembrandt—rendered in black and white to focus your attention on the scene itself. Four unique illustrations are generated for each story, allowing you to choose the one that speaks most powerfully to you.

## How It Works

When you open The Graham Bible, you'll find:

### 500 Stories, Chronologically Arranged
From Creation to Revelation, the entire biblical narrative is divided into 500 devotional moments. Each story covers a specific passage—sometimes a single chapter, sometimes spanning several—and presents it as a complete scene.

### Sacred Artwork for Every Story
Every story features AI-generated sacred art in the classical cross-hatching style. Four unique illustrations are created for each passage, each with a different artistic interpretation. You can view all four and select your favorite.

### Faithful Narrative Retellings
Each story includes a 440–520 word retelling that brings the Scripture to life. These aren't modern reinterpretations—they're faithful to the biblical text, using the King James Version for all quotations. The language is reverent and serious, honoring the weight of God's Word.

### A Key Verse to Carry With You
Every story highlights a key verse from the passage—a single line of Scripture to meditate on, memorize, or carry with you through your day.

## The Heart Behind the Project

The Graham Bible began as a family devotional project—a way to help our children (and ourselves) encounter Scripture with fresh eyes.

We believe that:

- **Scripture should be accessible.** The Bible is for everyone, not just scholars and theologians.
- **Stories shape us.** We remember narratives. We connect with characters. We learn through scenes and moments.
- **Beauty draws us in.** Art has the power to open our hearts to truths we might otherwise skim past.
- **Technology can serve faith.** AI is a tool. Used thoughtfully, it can help us create things that honor God and serve people.

Every summary is reviewed. Every piece of artwork is curated. The AI assists, but humans guide. This is a labor of love, not an algorithm.
