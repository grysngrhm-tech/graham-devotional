    Note: This site uses hash-based client-side routing (#/story/GEN-001).
    Search engines typically don't index hash fragments as separate URLs.
    The main page serves as the entry point where all 500 stories are discoverable.
    
    For better SEO in the future, consider:
    1. Server-side rendering (SSR) or static site generation (SSG)
    2. Path-based routing (/story/GEN-001 instead of #/story/GEN-001)
    3. Prerendering popular stories as static HTML
